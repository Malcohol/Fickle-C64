Fickle: a one-button real-time puzzle game for the Commodore 64

(C)2014 Malcolm Tyrrell

Thank you for playing Fickle. The original game was released in 2011 for the
unexpanded Commodore Vic-20. I hope you enjoy this new version.

## Advice
The timer gives you a lot more time than it will take for Fickle to reach the
heart, so I recommend you try to plan a route through the level before you
start.

## Rotor behaviour
In the original releases, clockwise rotors would fling Fickle to the left and
anticlockwise rotors would fling Fickle to the right. The reviewers of the C64
version suggested that this was counterintuitive. I tried the alternative, and
although it took a few moments to get used to it, I now feel that they are
correct. From now on, clockwise rotors will twist Fickle to the right and
anticlockwise rotors will twist Fickle to the left. If you prefer the original
behaviour, there is a rotor option in the settings menu.

## Cheating
You can skip levels with the Restore key, but this will cause the game to
withhold its love.

## Compatibility
Fickle is compatible with both PAL and NTSC C64s. The music is faster on NTSC
machines, but aside from that the two versions should be identical.

## Credits
Fickle was made with tools from the cc65 compiler suite (http://www.cc65.org/),
the Exomizer 2 compressor (http://hem.bredband.net/magli143/exo/), and the
Goattracker2 sid tracker software (http://covertbitops.c64.org/).

Thanks to all those responsible for the above.

Enjoy,

Malcolm
